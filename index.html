        <p>
            <br>iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. They run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS">Apple's iOS</a> mobile operating system. The first generation iPhone was released<br>on June 29, 2007, and there have been multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases since.<br>The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to cellular networks.<del> It<br>supports android apps.</del><i> As of January 2017, Apple's App Store contained more than 2.2 million applications available for the iPhone.</i><br><b>Apple has released ten generations of iPhone models</b>, each accompanied by one of the ten major releases of the iOS operating system. It was followed by the<br>3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice<br>assistant Siri. The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector. In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved<br>hardware and a fingerprint reader, and the lower-cost 5C, a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal.

            <u>In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus</u>, which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the<br>Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017,<br>adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera.<i> The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less<br>design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID.</i>
